# 💰💡 CrowdMint
Welcome to the CrowdMint DApp, a decentralized application that allows users to create and fund projects securely and transparently on the blockchain. 
## 📝 Project Overview
The CrowdMint DApp enables users to:

- Create Projects: Users can propose new projects and request funding to bring their ideas to life.
- Donate to Projects: Other users can contribute funds to projects they find interesting or valuable.
- Secure Blockchain Transactions: All transactions (project creation and donations) are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- User Authentication: Sign up and log in securely with data stored in MongoDB.
- MetaMask Integration: Users connect their MetaMask wallet to manage project creation and donation transactions, with a small gas fee for blockchain storage.
